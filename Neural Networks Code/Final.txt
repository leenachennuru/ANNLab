C = reshape(A, 1, prod(size(A)))

for i=1:3; j=1:3;

else A(i,j) = -1;

end
end


input number of neurons and number of patterns


input image name and read it

reshape the matrix

convert into 1s and -1s

feed this matrix as an input to module1

obtain the outputs

reshape the matrix

convert back to actual values

write the image

verify if the fixed point has been reached

if reached, then take that matrix as the output

reshape the matrix

convert back to actual values

write the image




current_state contains ur currentstate's 2D image matrice
store_2Dstate is another variable where im gonna store states

and whichisthis is an array
3 things we have, 

this is iteration 1 , do u wanna store state?
say no once
okay, so i do nothing
and the program does usual stuff
this is iteration 2 , do u wanna store state?


if (store_2D =empty) <which it is>
store_2Darray = currentstate;
if (whichstateisthis =emty) <which it is>
whichstateisthis = 2; <current iteration number>
now, we move on

this is iteration 3 , do u wanna store state?
 

SAYEE: 
no
 

Mayank: 
ok,moving on
this is iteration 4 , do u wanna store state
<say yes :P>

store_2Dstate =empty is NOT true
so the 'else' part is executed, which is
count = count +1; <initialize count to 1 at beginniong>
store_2Dstate[ : : count] =current state;
whichstateisthis [:count] = 4 ; <4=currentiteration number>
and then we go again
this is iteration 5 , do u wanna store state
etcetc

u goto whichstateisthis array, which is sorted..............pick out ur iteration <print error if it doesnt exist>
and print out the store_2Dstate [: : index]
point here was, store_2Dstate = 3 dimensional array
matlab supports n dimensional arrays

increment count everytime, and store like that...........
 
string = 'sayee'
and we have the whichisthisstate array

a='sayee'
b=1 (u put it as thestate where u took the reading)
c=[a,b]
imwrite (c)
c=[a,b]
 

SAYEE: 
i already tried that.....
 

Mayank: 
c=[c,'.bmp']
)




sampleop = rand(5,5)
for i=2:1:4
sampleop(:,:,i) = rand(5,5)
end

a='pattern'
b=[1:1:m];
for i = 1: 1: length(b)
c=[a,num2str(b(i)),'.bmp']
imwrite(v, c, 'bmp')
end
